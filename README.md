# Ecommerce AC Muebles con ReactJS

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. It serves as the foundation for an ecommerce platform built with ReactJS and VITE, allowing users to seamlessly add products to their shopping carts and generate purchase orders. All order data is securely stored and managed through integration with a Firebase database.
